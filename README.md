# Weather App: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind Project

## Introduction

This is a simple weather app built with OpenWeatherMap API

## Getting Started

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to run this project.

With [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script), I set the node version to LTS so that pnpm can run without errors:

```
nvm install --lts
```

Install packages:

```
pnpm i
```

then:

```
pnpm dev
```
